# Airline Reservation System

This is an airline reservation system built in C++ that allows users to book flights, reserve seats, check ticket details, and administrators to manage flight schedules. 

## Features

- User login to book tickets 
- Admin login to add, edit or delete flights
- Display available flights schedule
- Check seat availability 
- Reserve economy or first-class seats
- Generate ticket with passenger details
- Lookup passenger ticket info
- View booked seats/passengers on a flight

## Data Structures Used

- Linked lists to store flight schedule 
- 2D linked lists to model seating arrangement
- Dynamic memory allocation of nodes to book/cancel seats

## Skills Demonstrated

- Object-oriented programming concepts like classes and objects
- Modular code organization 
- Working with pointers and dynamic memory in C++
- File handling
- Data structures like linked lists
- Abstract data types like queues, stacks   
- Handling edge cases and validations

## How to Run

This program can be compiled using:

```
g++ airline_reservation.cpp
```

And executed with:

```
./a.exe
```

The user is then prompted with options to book/manage flights.

## Future Improvements

Some ways this project can be extended further:

- Add features like cancelling booked tickets
- Incorporate more flight details like date, destination etc
- Implement a database backend to store flight info
- Improve validation checks and exception handling
- Create a GUI version using Qt or Tkinter

## Learnings

Through this project I learned how to:
- Modularize a large C++ program using classes 
- Implement complex data structures like 2D linked lists
- Manage dynamic memory allocation and pointers
- Solve problems like flight seat reservation algorithm
- Think through edge cases in an airline booking scenario
